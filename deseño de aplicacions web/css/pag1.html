        <H2><A NAME=2>Title</A></H2>
The title of a document is given between title tags:
<code>		<TITLE> ... </TITLE>

</code>
The text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for the
hypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should
identify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should
ideally fit on one line.
</P>
<P>
The title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is
an attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,
or highlighting. the title may be used to identify the node in a history
list, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally
displayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with <A NAME=16 HREF=#15>headings</A>
.
<H2>Next ID</H2>Obsolete: NeXT Browser only.  May be ignored. This tag takes a  single
attribute which is the number of the next document-wide numeric identifier
to be allocated (not good SGML). Note that when modifying a document,
old anchor ids should not be reused, as there may be references stored
elsewhere which point to them.  This is read and generated by hypertext
editors. Human writers of HTML usually use mnemonic alpha identifiers.
Browser software may ignore this tag. Example of use:
<code>		<NEXTID 27/>

</code>
<H2><A NAME=11>Base Address</A></H2><A NAME=9 HREF=#4>Anchors</A> specify addresses of other documents, in a from relative to
the address of the current document. Normally, the address of a document
is known to the browser because it was used to access the document.
However, is a document is mailed, or is somehow visible with more
than one address (for example, via its filename and also via its library
name server catalogue number), then the browser needs to know the
base address in order to correctly deduce external document addresses.

The format of this tag is not yet specified. NOT CURRENTLY USED
<H2><A NAME=4>Anchors</A></H2>The format of an anchor is as follows:
<code>		<A NAME=xxx HREF=XXX> ... </A>

</code>The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the
start or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor
tag are as follows.
<DL>
<DT><A NAME=13>HREF</A>
<DD> If the HREF attribute is present, the anchor is senstive text:
the start of a link. If the reader selects this text,  he should be
presented with another document whose network address is defined by
the value of the HREF attribute . The format of the network address
is specified <A NAME=10 HREF=../Addressing/Addressing.html>elsewhere</A> . This allows for the form HREF=#identifier
to refer to another anchor in the same document. If the anchor is
in another document, the atribute is a <A NAME=14 HREF=../Addressing/Relative.html>relative name</A> , relative to
the documents address (or specified <A NAME=12 HREF=#11>base address</A> if any).
<DT>NAME
<DD> The attribute NAME allows the anchor to be the destination of
a link. The value of the parameter is that part of a hypertext address
which follows the <A NAME=19 HREF=../Addressing/BNF.html#21>hash sign</A> .
<DT><A NAME=21>TYPE</A>
<DD> An attribute TYPE may give the relationship described by the
hyertext link. The type is expressed by a string for extensibility.
Strings for types with particular semantics will be registered by
the W3 team. The default relationship if none other is given is void.
</DL>
All attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary
for the anchor to be useful.
<H2><A NAME=18>IsIndex</A></H2>This tag informs the reader that the document is an index document.
As well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword search.
</P>
<P>
Format:
<pre>		<ISINDEX/>

</pre>The node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing the node
address with a question mark, followed by a list of keywords separated
by plus signs. See the <A NAME=1 HREF=../Addressing/Search.html>network address format</A> .
