<H2 id="plaintext">Plaintext</H2>
This tag indicates that all following text is to be taken litterally,
up to the end of the file.  Plain text is designed to be represented
in the same way as example XMP text, with fixed width character and
significant line breaks. Format:
<XMP>			<PLAINTEXT></PLAINTEXT>

</XMP>This tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently without
parsing. Its presence is an optimisation. There is no closing tag.
<H2><A NAME=8>Example sections</A></H2>These styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded absolutely
as is into the document. The format is:
<pre>		<LISTING>
			...
		</LISTING>

</pre>The text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width font,
so that any formatting done by character spacing on successive lines
will be maintained. Between the opening and closing tags:
<UL>
<LI>The text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including
the tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in
full.
<LI>Line boundaries are significant, and are to be interpreted as a move
to the start of a new line.
<LI>The ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the
smallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number
of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not
recommended however.
</UL>The LISTING tag is portrayed so that at least 132 characters will
fit on a line.  The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least
80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.
The examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.
<H2>Paragraph</H2>This tag indicates a new paragraph. The exact representation of this
(indentation,  leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function
of other tags, style sheets etc. The format is simply
</P>
<pre>		

<P>

</pre>(In SGML terms, paragraph elements are transmitted in minimised form).
<H2><A NAME=15>Headings</A></H2>Several levels (at least six) of heading are supported. Note that
a hypertext document tends to need less levels of  heading than a
normal document whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.
H1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommened for the start
of a hypertext node.   It is suggested that the first heading be one
suitable for a reader who is already browsing in related information,
in contrast to the <A NAME=6 HREF=#2>title</A> tag which should identify the node in a wider
context.
<pre>		<H1>, <H2>, <H3>, <H4>, <H5>, <H6>

</pre>These tags are kept as defined in the CERN SGML guide. Their definition
is completely historical, deriving from the <A NAME=17 HREF=AAP.html>AAP</A> tag set.  A difference
is that HTML documents allow headings to be terminated by  closing
tags:
<pre>		<H2>Second level heading</h2>

</pre>
