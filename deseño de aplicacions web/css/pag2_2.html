justified or indented. The  format is:

<H2>Glossaries</H2>A glosary (or definition list) is a list of paragraphs each of which
has a short title alongside it.  Apart from glossaries, this format
is useful for presenting a set of named elements to the reader. The
format is as follows:
<pre>
		<DL>
		<DT>Term<DD>definition pagagraph
		<DT>Term2<DD>Definition of term2
		</DL>

</pre>
<H2>Lists</H2>A list is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which is preceded by a
special mark or sequence number. The format is:
<pre>
		<UL>
		<LI> list element
		<LI> another list element ...
		</UL>

</pre>The opening list tag  must be immediately followed by the first list
element. The representation of the list is not defined here, but a
bulleted list for unordered lists,  and a  sequence of numbered paragraphs
for an ordered list would be quite appropriate.  Other possibilities
for interactive display include embedded scrollable browse panels.

<P>
Opening list tags are:
<DL>
<DT>UL
<DD> A list multi-line paragraphs, typically separated by some white
space.
<DT>MENU
<DD> A list of smaller paragraphs. Typically one line per item, with
a style more compact than UL.
<DT>DIR
<DD> A list of short elements, less than one line. Typical style is
to arrange in four columns or provide a browser, etc.
</DL>
the closing tag must obviously match the opening tag.
