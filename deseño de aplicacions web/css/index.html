<H1>HTML Tags</H1>
This is a list of tags used in the <A NAME=0 HREF=MarkUp.html#4>HTML</A> language.  Each tag starts
with a tag opener (a less than sign) and ends with a tag closer (a
greater than sign).   Many tags have corresponding closing tags which
identical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the<A NAME=3 HREF=#2>
TITLE</A> tag).
<P>
Some tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given
after the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect
simply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and
a value. (See the <A NAME=5 HREF=#4>Anchor</A> tag, for example). The names of tags and
attributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or
mixed case with exactly the same meaning.  (In this document they
are generally represented in upper case.)

<P>
Currently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing
tags, but if these are included parsers will ignore them.
